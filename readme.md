# Scheduler Application

Welcome to the Rust Scheduler app. This will serve as a very quick guide on how to read this project best. This project is split into 3 main components; the `clock` module, the `gui` module, and the main module (the files in `src`). The `clock` and main modules are the *backend*, so to speak, and contain most of the smart logic for this program. The `gui` module contains a lot of code written for `GTK`, which is a foreign library, and is not often commented as there is a lot of unavoidable boilerplate code.

The contents of each module:

`clock` module:
- Date struct (for 2019-11-05)
- Day struct  (for Thursday)
- Time struct (for 09:30)

main module:
- Application struct (contains a list of courses and holidays)
- Course struct (contains Date and Task)
- Task struct (contains Date)

For more information on how these structures work together, see the comments in their respective files.

Everything in the `target/` directory is generated by Cargo, and is NOT necessary for viewing. The `Cargo.toml` file contains a list of dependencies and some basic information about the project (name, description). The `Cargo.lock` file is a lock file, as the name suggests. It's generated by Cargo and is NOT necessary for viewing. `.gitignore` is a file for the git versioning system.
